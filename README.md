Here's my solution to the task. I made some modifications to the project to allow for selecting and deselecting all items on the list. Additionally, the counter adds and subtracts their number. It was a really interesting task that helped me learn a lot. Please, I'd appreciate a code review if anyone would like to provide some tips.
